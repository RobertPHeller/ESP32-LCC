# ABSWithSiding

This directory contains files relating to my ABS (Automatic Block Signals) 
with siding N-Scale layout module that demos my ESP32 Half-Siding boards, 
along with some other OpenLCB/LCC boards.  The N-Scale layout module is meant 
to be something I can take to model rr shows to demo using OpenLCB/LCC for 
layout control.
