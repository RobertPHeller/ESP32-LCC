\subsection{Automatic Block Signals}
\label{sect-appl:ABS}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%

Figure~\ref{fig:ABSTrack} is a simple bi-directional segment of ABS signaled 
track, with four blocks and four signals, wired to a node as follows:

\begin{description}
\item [OC 1] Block 1
\item [OC 2] Block 2
\item [OC 3] Block 3
\item [OC 4] Block 4
\item [A0(R), A1(Y), A2(G)] Signal 2E
\item [A3(R), A4(Y), A5(G)] Signal 3E
\item [B0(R), B1(Y), B2(G)] Signal 2W
\item [B3(R), B4(Y), B5(G)] Signal 3W
\end{description}

Each signal will use three Logic elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Will be triggered true if the block is occupied and will select the Stop 
rule.
\item Will be triggered true if the next signal mast is stop (via a track 
circuit) and will select the Approach rule.
\item Will always be true and will select the Clear rule.
\end{enumerate}
