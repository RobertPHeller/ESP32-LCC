# 16PWMLedDriverPocketBeagle

This is a PCA9685 with two octal buffers meant to drive 16 LEDs (such as
signal lamps). This board is much like 16DriverOutputCape, but uses a PWM chip
to allow for special effects and allows for brightness adjustment. Has address
jumpers for the PCA9685, includes a CAN transceiver, 5V power supply for the 
PocketBeagle, and uses LCC power for the LEDS.  It uses female headers for the 
PocketBeagle (presumes male pin headers soldered to the underside of the 
PocketBeagle).
