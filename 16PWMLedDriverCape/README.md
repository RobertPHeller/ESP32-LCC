# 16PWMLedDriverCape

This is a PCA9685 with two octal buffers meant to drive 16 LEDs (such as 
signal lamps).  This board is much like 16DriverOutputHat, but uses a PWM chip 
to allow for special effects and allows for brightness adjustment.  Has 
address jumpers for the PCA9685 and can be stacked -- up to 64 boards (WOW) 
for up to 1024 LEDs (WOW) -- each board has power terminals for the LEDs.
