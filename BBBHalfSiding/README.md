# BBBHalfSiding

Early HalfSiding cape for the Beagle Bone Black. A somewhat all-in-one board
for the Beagle Bone Black to manage one half of a siding. This something of a
"kitchen sink" board and proably awkard in practice. Probably better off
stacking several separate special purpose capes.  I mostly did this as a 
"thought experiment" to see what this would look like.  Oh, if it used SMD 
parts it might be more compact and might be practical as a single board.
