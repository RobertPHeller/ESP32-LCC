This is a MCP23017 with two octal buffers meant to drive 16 LEDs (such as 
signal lamps). No PWM or special effects.  This board is a HAT for a 
Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4.  Has address jumpers for the MCP23017 and can be 
stacked -- up to 8 of these hats for up to 128 LEDS -- each board has power 
terminals for the LEDs.
