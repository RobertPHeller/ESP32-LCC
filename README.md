# RPi-RRCircuits

These are a collection of model railroad circuits I designed for the Raspberry 
Pi.  All but two use the "HAT" footprint and are meant to be stacked onto a 
RPi.  The other two are "generic" and expect to be connected to 3.3V GPIO 
pins.

These projects were created using Kicad 2013.06.11
(https://launchpad.net/kicad) under CentOS 6 and Kicad 4.0.7 under Ubuntu
18.04. Each subdirectory is one project, and contains a schematic and PCB
design.  There is also software for the boards using OpenMRN (C++ library for 
OpenLCB/LCC) for these projects.

There is a README in each project dir.
