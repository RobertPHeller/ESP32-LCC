\chapter{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD: Half Siding board base board for an ESP32 Dev Kit MCU board}

This is a circuit board that supports an ESP32 Dev Kit board or TTGO-T1 board 
to manage one half (one end) of a siding.  This board can also be used to 
manage two bi-directional single track ABS blocks or one bi-directional dual 
track ABS block.  There are other trackwork cases this board can handle as 
well.  The board contains these I/O sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two occupancy detectors.  These are opto-isolator based, so they will 
work for both DC and DCC systems.
\item Two stall-motor with point sense.
\item Sixteen PWM Led drivers.  These are meant to light lamps in signal 
heads.
\end{itemize}

This board uses six GPIO pins and one I2C channel:

\begin{description}
\item[GPIO0] Motor Select 1: select the position of stall motor 1.
\item[GPIO12] Motor Select 2: select the position of stall motor 2.
\item[GPIO34] Point Sense 1: return the state of the points for 
stall motor 1. 
\item[GPIO35] Point Sense 2: return the state of the points for 
stall motor 2. 
\item[GPIO26] Occupancy Detector 1.
\item[GPIO27] Occupancy Detector 2.
\item[GPIO16] (Optional) Output enable for the PWM LED Controller.
\item[I2C Address 0x40] A PCA9685 16-channel, 12-bit PWM LED Controller.
\end{description}

Each of the motor drive circuits is through a TC4428, which can drive up to
1.5A, which is way more needed to drive a typical stall motor. It is enough to
drive a pair of stall motors, wired in parallel as would be the case for a
cross over. 

\section{Circuit Description}


\subsection{Turnout Control}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-1.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 1 (ESP32 MCU and 
Turnout Driver and Sense)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

The turnout control has two parts. There is an output section that contains
two TC4428 chips. Each chip has a non-inverting and an inverting driver. The
inputs of both drivers are connected to one of the motor GPIO pins. The output
are wired to the terminal block for a one of the motors. For any given logic
state of the motor control output, one of the drivers is ``on'' and the other
is ``off'', thus one motor terminal is ground and one is raised to the 12V
supply. This means alternative states of the logic line will drive the stall
motor in alternative directions. 

The other section is a pair of flip-flop debounce circuits, one for each of
two SPDT switch contacts that report the position of the turnout points. The
output of these flip-flops goes to a pair of GPIO input pins.

\clearpage
\subsection{CAN Transceiver}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-2.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 2 (CAN Transceiver)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

This section contains the CAN Transceiver, along with a termination jumper 
block. Power insertion and pick off and the RJ45 Jacks.

\clearpage
\subsection{Power Supply}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-3.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 3 (Power Supply)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

This section contains a 5V power supply that takes the nominal 12V on the CAN 
power bus and regulates it down to 5V to supply the ESP32 MCU board.

\clearpage
\subsection{Occupancy Detectors}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-4.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 4 (Occupancy 
Detector 1)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-5.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 5 (Occupancy 
Detector 2)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

The occupancy detectors use optoisolators in series with the track power 
supply.  There is a heavy duty bridge rectifier in parallel with the 
optoisolators to carry the bulk of the current to the track.  They will work 
with either DC or DCC track power.

\clearpage
\subsection{PWM LED Driver}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD-6.pdf}
\caption{Circuit Diagram of the ESP32-PWMHalfSidingSMD, page 6 (PWM LED Driver)}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

The PWM LED Driver uses a PCA9685 which is a 16 channel, 12 bit PWD LED 
driver.  A pair of octal MOSFET drivers and series load resistors are also 
included on the board.  The MOSFET drivers come in both inverting (low-side 
drive) and non-inverting (high-side drive), so it is possible to support both 
common anode and common cathode LED signals.

\subsection{Notes on Building the board}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32HalfSidingWiringSMD.png}
\caption{Placement of terminal blocks, connectors, and jumper blocks.}
\end{centering}\end{figure}

The board comes with all the surface mount devices soldered to the board.  All 
you need to do is solder the through-hole parts, which consists of:

\begin{description}
\item[Screw Terminals] 3 2-position 2.54 pitch terminals (LCC power in and
out, lamp power in), 2 5-position 2.54 pitch terminals (motor 1 and motor
2), 2 9-position 2.54 pitch terminals (signal lamp outputs), and 2 2-position
5.08 pitch terminals (Occ. Det. 1 and Occ. Det. 2). 
\item[Pin Headers] 1 2x2 pin header (termination jumpers) and 1 1x3 pin header
(I2C SCL GPIO selection).
\item[Connectors] 2 RJ45 connectors (LCC Network).
\item[Pin Socket Headers] 2 19x1 and 1 18x1, for the MCU module.
\end{description}

For most of these parts you should solder one pin and then while pressing the
part against the board, reflow the solder to make sure the part is tight and
square to the board before letting the solder cool while holding the part
tight to the board. Before soldering the rest of the pins, check that the part
is fully tight and flush to the board. Also for the screw terminals, make sure
the wire openings are facing out from the board. The install ordering is from
shortest to tallest parts.

\clearpage
\section{Downloadables and Software Support}

As shipped, the TTGO-T1 has already had the ESP32-PWMHalfSiding firmware
installed, but if you want to rebuild the code (possibly with customizations)
the code is on GitHub in my ESP32-LCC repo:
\url{https://github.com/RobertPHeller/ESP32-LCC}, in the
ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOpenMRNIDF sub-folder. You will need the Espressif's IoT
Development Framework, version 4.2 or later, available from
\url{https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf}. The ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOpenMRNIDF
also uses Mike Dunston's OpenMRNID module -- be sure to do ``git submodule
update --init'' after cloning https://github.com/RobertPHeller/ESP32-LCC.


\subsection{Building and installing the software}

Once you have installed Espressif's IoT Development Framework and cloned the 
ESP32-LCC repo, you can build the software by cd'ing to the 
ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOpenMRNIDF and in bash running these commands:

\begin{verbatim}
. path-to-Espressifs-IDF/export.sh
idf.py build
\end{verbatim}

You can then use the idf.py's flash command to flash the TTGO-T1.

\subsubsection{WiFi notes}

The default configuration is with WiFi disabled. Using both the CAN interface
\textbf{and} WiFi at the same time on the ESP32 is not recomended. The
processor cannot handle both well. It is possible to enable the WiFi code.
This is done by using the menuconfig command with idf.py and then re-building
the firmware. This adds some additional config options to the CDI relating to 
WiFi.

\subsection{Program Description}

The program consists of a main sketch file, and several support files and
``components'' (libraries).

\subsection{Program Startup notes}

While most of the common node configuration is accessable using the available
CDI configuruation tools (JMRI's PanelPro program or MRR SYS OpenLCB program), 
some of the nodes configuration is in separate non-volitle (flash) memory.  
This includes the node's ID number and some boot options.  As installed the 
node ID is initialized to 05:01:01:01:22:00.  \textbf{You don't really want to 
leave this as the node id!}  There are two ways to set the node id.  One way 
is to use a CDI configuruation tool -- the node ID is exposed as a 
configuration option.  Changes the node id forces a ``factory reset'' on the 
next boot (and when you update the configuration with a CDI configuruation 
tool, the node will reboot).  The other way is during the boot up process.  
When the node boots, it waits on the USB serial connection for 10 seconds for 
any ``keyboard'' response and if it gets a ``keyboard'' response, it enters a 
simple command line loop accepting simple commands (mostly single letters). 
To use this feature you need to connect a a USB cable between the TTGO-T1 and 
a computer (eg a PC or Mac) and then connect to the USB Com port with a 
terminal program (the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor should work).  The commands 
that the boot startup command line loop supports are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{N} Set the node id.  Follow the ``N'' with a 12 digit hex 
number, with optional periods or colons.  Causes a Factory Reset.
\item \textbf{E} Reset events on boot up.
\item \textbf{F} Force a Factory Reset.
\item \textbf{S} WiFi ssid\footnote{Only useful if WiFi is 
enabled.\label{fn:wifi}}. Enter the ssid after the ``S'', leading and trailing 
spaces are stripped off.
\item \textbf{P} WiFi password\footref{fn:wifi}. Enter the password after the 
``P'', leading and trailing spaces are stripped off.
\item \textbf{H} Hostname prefix\footref{fn:wifi}. Enter the hostname prefix 
after the ``H'', leading and trailing spaces are stripped off. The NODE ID in 
hex is appended.  Hostnames are limited to 32 characters.
\item \textbf{W} Enable WiFi\footref{fn:wifi}. Enter ``YES'', ``NO'', 
``ON'', or ``OFF'' after the ``W''.
\item \textbf{T} Test signal lamps\footnote{Each of the signal lamps is 
flashed for 1 second during boot up.}.
\item \textbf{R} Resume.
\end{itemize}

\section{General Wiring Notes}

There are various terminal blocks, connectors, and jumper blocks on this
board. At the top right corner of the board are a pair of two position
terminal blocks, one for injecting power into the LCC bus and one for
extracting power from the LCC bus. Between these terminal blocks is the
termination jumper block for the LCC bus. Below the LCC power terminal blocks
is a pair of RJ45 connectors. These are for connecting the board to the LCC
bus. These connectors are wired in parallel. Down along the left side are the
two stall motor terminal blocks (small 5 position terminal blocks) and the
occupancy detector terminal blocks (large 2 position terminal blocks). On the
right side are two 9 position terminal blocks for the signal lamp LEDs.
Finally, between the terminal blocks for the signal lamp LEDs is a two
position terminal block to (optionally) provide power for the signal lamp
LEDs.

\subsection{LCC Power}

Power can be optionally injected into the LCC bus or extracted from the LCC 
bus. Power can be injected to into the LCC bus to power this and other boards. 
Power can also be extracted to power local devices.

\subsection{I2C SCL GPIO Selection}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics{I2C-SCL-Jumper_edited.png}
\caption{I2C SCL Jumper Options}
\label{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingI2CSCLJumper}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
There is a jumper to selecting the GPIO pin to use for I2C SCL line.  If you 
are using an ESP32 DevKit you would use GPIO 22.  If you are using a Lily Go 
TTGO-T1, you might want to use GPIO 23 since GPIO 22 on the TTGO-T1 is wired 
to its on-board LED and this has been known to cause issues with the I2C 
interface.  If you select Arduino IDE's board type ``TTGO-T1'', SCL is mapped 
to GPIO 23 -- it is possible to select the generic ESP32 DevKit as the board 
type to compile for the ``TTGO-T1'', in which case SCL is mapped to GPIO 22.  
You should install a shunt jumper that matches how you compiled the firmware.

\subsection{LCC Bus connections and termination}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingTermination.png}
\caption{Termination Jumper Options}
\label{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingTermination}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
The two RJ45 connections connect to the LCC bus.  If this board is at the end 
of bus, you will need to terminate the bus.  There are two possible 
termination options as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingTermination}.

\subsection{Stall Motor connections}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%

\caption{Wiring a Tortoise to the ESP32-PWMHalfSiding Turnout Motors terminals}

\end{centering}\end{figure}
The five position Stall Motor terminal blocks, shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingTurnoutMotorsFig}, connect to the turnout 
stall motors, the Motor A and Motor B connections go to the motor (pins 1 and 
8 of a tortoise), the other three connections go to a single pole double 
through switch contacts to sense the position of the stall motor / points. 
There are contacts available on tortoise stall motor that can be used for this 
purpose, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingTotoiseWiring}.

\clearpage
\subsection{Occupancy Detector connections}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics{ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOccupancyDetectors.png}
\caption{Occupancy Detector Wiring}
\label{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOccupancyDetectors}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
The larger two position Occupancy Detector terminal blocks are connected to 
the track power feeds as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32-PWMHalfSidingOccupancyDetectors}.

\clearpage
\section{Application Notes}

Two applications will presented, a typical siding using two boards and an
implementation of a section of Automatic Block Signals. Other trackwork
arrangements are possible as well.


\subsection{Typical Siding}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ExampleSiding.png}
\caption{A Typical Siding}
\label{fig:ExampleSiding}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{ESP32HalfSiding-CP1Wiring.png}
\caption{Wiring the ESP32HalfSiding board to the control elements of CP1 (West 
end of the siding)}
\label{fig:ESP32HalfSiding-CP1Wiring}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
A typical siding is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ExampleSiding}. And the wiring of 
the west end, CP1, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32HalfSiding-CP1Wiring}. The 
other end is wired similarly (except that the second occupancy detector is 
wired to the main line block between the turnouts).

\subsubsection{Configuring the CP1 node (west end)}

\paragraph{Node identification configuration}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-ID-Config-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 Node ID configuration}
\label{fig:CP1-ID-Config}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
First the node's user name and description is configured.  This makes it easier 
to find the node in the node listing.

\clearpage
\paragraph{Occupancy Detector configuration}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-OC-Config-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 Occupancy Detectors configuration}
\label{fig:CP1-OC-Config}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
Next we configure the Occupancy Detectors.  All we do at this point is fill in 
the names of the blocks.  This helps us when we grab the event ids later.
 
\clearpage
\paragraph{Turnout and Points configuration}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-Turnout-Config-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 Turnout and Points configuration}
\label{fig:CP1-Turnout-Config}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
Next we configure the Turnout and Points.  All we do at this point is fill in 
the name of the turnout.  We fill in the name for both the turnout and the 
points.  Only turnout 1 and points 1 are configured, since we are only using 
motor 1.

\clearpage
\paragraph{Signal mast configuration}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-Mast1-Config-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1, Mast1 configuration}
\label{fig:CP1-Mast1-Config}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
Now we skip down to the masts. Mast 1 is the two head signal at the points
entrance, named CP1ME (Control Point 1, main, eastbound). We set its Mast ID
and copy and past its Track Circuit Link Address to Circuit 1. This is a 3
(green-yellow-red) over 2 (yellow-red) signal. It has 4 rules:
\begin{table}[htbp]\begin{centering}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Tab&Rule Name&Track Speed&Appearance\\
\hline
Rule 1&0-Stop&Stop&Red over Red\\
Rule 2&21-Approach&Approach&Yellow over Red\\
Rule 3&29-Clear&Clear/Proceed&Green over Red\\
Rule 4&1-Take Siding&Slow&Red over Yellow\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{CP1ME's Rules}
\label{tab:CP1MERules}
\end{centering}\end{table}
The LEDs are wired to lamp group A as follows (see Figure~\ref{fig:ESP32HalfSiding-CP1Wiring}: 
\begin{description}
\item[A0] Upper Green
\item[A1] Upper Yellow
\item[A2] Upper Red
\item[A3] Lower Yellow
\item[A4] Lower Red
\end{description}
Lamp 1 will be the upper head and Lamp 2 will be for the lower head:
\begin{description}
\item[Rule 1: 0-Stop] Red over Red -- Lamp 1 will be A2 (upper red) and Lamp 2 
will be A4 (lower red).
\item[Rule 2: 21-Approach] Yellow over Red -- Lamp 1 will be A1 (upper yellow) 
and Lamp 2 will be A4 (lower red).
\item[Rule 3: 29-Clear] Green over Red -- Lamp 1 will be A0 (upper green) and 
Lamp 2 will be A4 (lower red).
\item[Rule 4: 1-Take Siding] Red over Yellow -- Lamp 1 will be A2 (upper red) 
and Lamp 2 will be A3 (lower yellow).
\end{description}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Logic block configuration}

\subparagraph{Logic for interlocking}
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%                                         
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-OSVeto-Normal1-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 OS Veto, part 1 (description, group function, variable 1)}

\end{centering}\end{figure}                                                    
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%                                         
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-OSVeto-Normal2-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 OS Veto, part 2 (variable 2)}
\label{fig:CP1-OSVeto-Normal2}
\end{centering}\end{figure}                                                    
\begin{figure}[hbpt]\begin{centering}%                                         
\includegraphics[width=5in]{CP1-OSVeto-Normal3-Annotated.png}
\caption{CP1 OS Veto, part 3 (Action 1)}
\label{fig:CP1-OSVeto-Normal3}
\end{centering}\end{figure}                                                    
Next we use the CP1 OS occupancy detector as a veto to prevent moving the 
points while a train is occupying the turnout.  This is done with two logic 
elements.  One logic handles the normal request and the other handles the 
reverse request.  The second variable consumer events for these logics become 
the external events consumed for throwing the turnout and the variable 2 
events for the first logic are cross copied to the second logic.

\clearpage
\subparagraph{Logic for signal CP1ME}
This signal uses a chain of four logic blocks to implement this logic:
\begin{verbatim}
if OS is occupied then
    show Stop
else if CP1 points aligned for the siding then
    show Take Siding
else if Main line beyond the turnout is occupied then
    show Approach
else
    show Clear
\end{verbatim}

First we configure the logic element for the Stop aspect (the most restrictive 
aspect) of signal CP1ME, as shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-Stop-Logic-Config1}, \ref{fig:CP1ME-Stop-Logic-Config2}, and

Next we configure the logic element for the Take Siding aspect (the next 
restrictive aspect) of signal CP1ME, as shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-TakeSiding-Logic-Config1} and 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-TakeSiding-Logic-Config2}.

Next we configure the logic element for the Approach aspect (the next 
restrictive aspect) of signal CP1ME, as shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-Approach-Logic-Config1} and 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-Approach-Logic-Config2}. We have not set up the events for the 
variable yet, since these events will come from the other ESP32-PWMHalfSiding 
board's second occupancy detector, which is for the main line between the 
sidings.

Lastly we configure the logic element for the Clear aspect (the least 
restrictive aspect) of signal CP1ME, as shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-Clear-Logic-Config1} and 
\ref{fig:CP1ME-Clear-Logic-Config2}. This is an unconditional logic and is the 
last in this chain.

The other two signal masts are similarly configured.  There are three rules 
(stop, approach, and clear) and three logic cells for each mast.  The logic 
cell for stop is the OR of the OS section (variable 1) being occupied and the 
point state (variable 2).  The approach logic depends on the track circuit for 
the block in front of the points (a dummy mast can be set up for this, using 
an off node occupancy detector).

\label{fig:ABSTrack_Wiring}
\end{centering}\end{figure}
A stretch of Bi-directional track with ABS is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ABSTrack} and Figure~\ref{fig:ABSTrack_Wiring} shows how two 
of the blocks would be wired to a ESP32 HalfSiding board. Additional boards 
would be used for additional pairs of blocks.

Configuring the masts and logic cells is similar to the masts and logic cells: 
the stop logic uses the occupancy detector, the approach logic uses the track 
circuit for the block beyond the current, and the clear logic is the null/true 
logic mode.
