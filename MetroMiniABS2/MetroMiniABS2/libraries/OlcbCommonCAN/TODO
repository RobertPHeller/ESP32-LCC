Streams is just a scaffold at present; buffer management needs thought

Datagram interface needs to transfer source ID of received datagrams,
so reply datagrams can be properly routed back.

Need to devise a way to have multiple datagram processors called
in sequence, with the first one to consume the datagram
causing the proper ack/nak to be sent & ending the sequence.
Default should actually be "don't know what to do with this"
if all fall through.

Configuration needs code for testing actual read/write response.

Need to check for frame being handled, datagram being handled, etc.
