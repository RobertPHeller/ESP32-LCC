\subsection{Crossing with interchange}
\label{sect-appl:crossinginterchange}

This is a level crossing with an interchange track.  We will control and 
manage this crossing and interchange with three ESP32 T7S3 MultiFunction 
Universal Turnout nodes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CrossingInterchange}. The 
three nodes will implement these functions:

\begin{description}
\item [CPNorth] This node will manage the north turnout and the signals around 
it.  It will also provide occupancy detection for the turnout OS section and 
the north-south track segment. It will be wired as following:
\begin{description}
\item [OC 1] The turnout OS section.
\item [OC 2] The north-south track segment.
\item [Turnout 1] The north turnout motor.
\item [Points 1] The north turnout points.
\item [A0(UR), A1(UY), A2(UG), A3(LR), A4(LY), A5(LG)] The signal at the north 
(points) end of the turnout.
\item [B0(R), B1(Y), B2(G)] The interchange segment (divergent frog) 
end of the turnout.
\item [B3(R), B4(Y), B5(G)] The north-south track segment 
(non-divergent frog) end of the turnout.
\end{description} 
\item [CPWest] This node will manage the west turnout and the signals 
around it.  It will also provide occupancy detection for the turnout OS 
section, the east-west track segment, and the interchange track segment.  It 
will be wired as following: 
\begin{description}
\item [OC 1] The turnout OS section.
\item [OC 2] The east-west track segment.
\item [OC 3] The interchange track segment
\item [Turnout 1] The west turnout motor.
\item [Points 1] The west turnout points.
\item [A0(UR), A1(UY), A2(UG), A3(LR), A4(LY), A5(LG)] The signal at the west 
(points) end of the turnout.
\item [B0(R), B1(Y), B2(G)] The interchange segment (divergent frog) 
end of the turnout.
\item [B3(R), B4(Y), B5(G)] The east-west track segment 
(non-divergent frog) end of the turnout.
\end{description} 
\item [CPCrossing] This node will manage the crossing diamond, including the 
signals around it along with occupancy detection of the diamond itself.  It 
will be wired as following: 
\begin{description}
\item [OC 1] The east-west part of the crossing.
\item [OC 2] The north-south part of the crossing.
\item [A0(R), A1(Y), A2(G)] The signal at the west end of the crossing.
\item [A3(R), A4(Y), A5(G)] The signal at the east end of the crossing.
\item [B0(R), B1(Y), B2(G)] The signal at the north end of the crossing.
\item [B3(R), B4(Y), B5(G)] The signal at the south end of the crossing.
\end{description}
\end{description}

The CPNorth and CPWest will actually be configured following the much the same 
methods as an end of a siding, as describe in 
Section~\ref{sect-appl:siding}\footnote{The local control buttons and LEDs are
not shown here - they could be added or left out as desired.} Since we are 
using 3 over 3 signals at the points ends of the turnouts, it is possible to 
add additional aspects, including the state of the crossing and the far end of 
the interchange track.
