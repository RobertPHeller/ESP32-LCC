\chapter{ESP32-S3-MultiFunction: Multifunction board using an ESP32-S3FN8}

This is a circuit board that is based around an Espressif ESP32-S3FN8 MCU to
manage and operate a collection of model railroad sensors and actuators. The 
board contains these I/O sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Four occupancy detectors.  CT Coil type sensors, so they won't work with 
DC systems without an AC bias.
\item Four stall-motor drivers with point sense.
\item Four Schmitt Trigger inputs, meant for push buttons.
\item Four Buffered outputs, by default for Panel LEDS, but with drop in 
resistors, can also drive relays or other loads.
\item Sixteen PWM Led drivers.  These are meant to light lamps in signal 
heads.
\end{itemize}
